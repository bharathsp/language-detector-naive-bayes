# language-detector-naive-bayes
This project implements a Language Detection Model using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. It classifies text inputs into their respective languages by leveraging text preprocessing techniques and applies GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
